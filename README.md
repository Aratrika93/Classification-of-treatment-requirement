# Classification-of-treatment-requirement
The task for this problem set was to design a classification model that will classify the classes treatment recommended & treatment not recommended into two groups. 
A good performance out of the model is expected as the model is taking on the role of a human doctor in classifying whether a patient needs treatment or not. 
We have used two measures of evaluation, the AUC score & the True negative-True Positive spread from a confusion matrix. Additionally, an assessment was asked to make 
regarding the impact the additional features MeasureA , TestB, GeneA, GeneB & GeneC, will have on task of classifying if treatment is recommended or not.
